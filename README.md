In this Yavapai County Project, Northern Arizona University W.A. Franke College of Business Alliance Bank Economic Policy Institute (EPI) worked with Northern Arizona Council of Governments (NACOG) and Yavapai leaders to analyze the effects of COVID-19 on the county's economy.

The EPI created a survey to be sent to businesses in the county. The link for the survey was given to NACOG and Yavapai leaders who sent the link out to their constituents. EPI analyzed the data and made it available through this website.
